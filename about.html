      <h2>Members</h2>
      <h3>Aleksi Heikkilä, Vocals</h3>
      <p>The singer of Moffat. Off-stage he seems like a calm mannered person, but when he gets on the stage to sing
        and perform, he becomes the heart and soul of Moffat.
      </p>
      <h3>Jan Moilanen, Drums</h3>
      <p>Jan is the cornerstone of Moffat, keeping the rhythm and blasting fills you've never heard before.
      </p>
      <h3>Aleksi Hakala, Guitar</h3>
      <p>Every band needs a guitarist bursting with sexual energy, good looks and flaming hot solos. Hakala is
        exactly that. On stage he is showing off his skills and how he enjoys the music he is performing.
      </p>
      <h3>Napsa Ikola, Bass</h3>
      <p>The near-perfect playing and explosive stage presence Napsa gives out is the pinnacle of bass players
        (according
        to us).
        He has the rhythm, the energy and the required skill to pull off amazing lines that compliment the other players
        in the band.
      </p>

      <h2>Formation</h2>
      <p>Moffat was formed back in 2020 by Aleksi Heikkilä and Jan Moilanen. They realized that only a singer
        and a drummer wouldn't be enough for the extravagant energy pump that they were looking for, therefore they
        asked Napsa Ikola to join and play the bass. Heikkilä was keen on playing the guitar and singing, but they came
        to the conclusion that a separate guitarist is needed, hence they asked Aleksi Hakala to join the band.
      </p>
      <h2>First EP</h2>
      <p>After composing and making several songs, Moffat decided to record and put out an EP. It was done rather
        low-budget, using their school-provided facilities. It turned out rather well and you can
        listen to it <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/31HnmSQOr52g5BwrRpICdg?si=-IZC69WrSCyLTrlV4x9Dmw"
          target="_blank">here</a>
      </p>
      <h2>First gigs and making of the first album</h2>
      <p>In 2022 Moffat booked their first gig ever at Poppari, Jyväskylä. A nice little jazz bar that turned into
        a grunge-cave during the showtime. There were two other bands accompanying Moffat: Vaisto and Malamujer.
        The night was magical and the crowd loved it. <br>
        The next gig was at Bar Loose, Helsinki and it was really the quiet place to play.
        Not many people came about, but atleast the energy was there. <br>
        After the gigs the band decided to start recording new songs that they had
        in their setlist and during the autumn and winter of 2022, Moffat recorded half of the songs.
        On January 2023 the recording process is still on-going but everything is almost finished.
